# 100Devs 100 Hour Project

Before the pandemic hit I was a concert photographer, a role i stumbled upon as I racked up a signficant number of concerts. 
I started off with just an android phone where I was given control of features like ISO and aperture. Back then all I really 
knew was that messing with those controls impacted the way the picture came out. The first time I brought my camera to a show 
I tried to memorize all the popular controls I saw other photographers using. As I revisited a lot of the same venues I found 
myself relying on the similar settings for certain places. Understanding the lughting and the best places to shoot allowed me 
to taake shots like these. Being a new concert photographer there were a lot of tips and tricks and general insight I wish I 
had been able to ask my peers...And so the idea of the NYC Concert Photography Network was born!
